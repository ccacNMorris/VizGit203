# The Influential Voter
### My data for good project focuses on the comparison between the baby boomer population and the millenial population.  Research shows that the baby boomer and millenial populations are about the same in quantity.  Despite the closeness in population size baby boomers tend to be the more influential voter.  

### The goal of this project was to highlight the fact that with a bit more turnout from the millenial population we could also become influential voters.  Being an influential voter means that elected officials are more likely to vote and pass legislation that positively effects you. I used exit polling statistics for the 2016 election in order to display the comaprison between the two voter demographics.

## Population
### Baby Boomer: defined as someone who was born between 1946-1964
#### 72.56 million pop
### Millenial: defined as someone who was born between 1981-1966
#### 72.06 million pop

## Voters
### 138 million total voted in 2016 election
### 48.1 million Baby Boomers
### 31.3 million Millenials 
### With a population of 72.06 million if 16.8 million more millenials voted they would have voted at the same rate as the most influential voting demographic

#### As a diclaimer - Exit polling data sometimes varies and cannot always be accurate due to reporting inconsistencies.  Also the definition of baby boomers and millenials was taken from Pew Research but is not the only definition out there to define the two generations.
