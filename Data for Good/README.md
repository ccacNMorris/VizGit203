# The Influential Voter
### My data for good project focuses on the comparison between the baby boomer population and the millenial population.  Research shows that the baby boomer and millenial populations are about the same in quantity.  Despite the closeness in population size baby boomers tend to be the more influential voter.  

### The goal of this project was to highlight the fact that with a bit more turnout from the millenial population we could also become influential voters.  Being an influential voter means that elected officials are more likely to vote and pass legislation that positively effects you. I used exit polling statistics for the 2016 election in order to display the comaprison between the two voter demographics.

## Population
