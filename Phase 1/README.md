# Phase 1: Planning

## The Do's to Todo's

### Inquiry Question:
#### How does visualizing my daily routine effect my motivation to complete all daily tasks?  If there is an increase in motivation change other factors in my life?

### Rationale:
#### I wanted to see if there was a more efficient way to complete my daily and weekly tasks.  By finding the most effective schedule I am hoping to be healthier, less stressed, and more productive.

### Hypothesis:
#### I hypothesize that by having a visual of my daily schedule it will motivate me to complete all tasks.  By completing all tasks I will create a healthier and more productive lifestyle for myself.  I am uncertain whether this approach is sustainable due to the unpredictsability of life.  Variables can pop up spontaneously that make the schedule impossible to follow.

### Variable Interest:
#### I am interested to see the effects of waking up earlier than I am used to.  Your morning routine kind of sets the tone for the rest of the day and is the determining facotr on whether the rest of the tasks get done.  I am also very interested in how having a visual of my schedule will shift my demanor towards completing tasks consistently.
