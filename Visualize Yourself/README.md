## The Do's to Todo's

### Inquiry Question:
#### What is the overall effectiveness of the calendar schedule?
#### Is there a completely postive correlation between task completion and life balance.

### Rationale:
#### I wanted to see if looking at a calendar schedule each morning and night would improve my motivation to complete certain tasks throughout the day.   I also wanted to see whether following the schedule or not would effect my feeling of life balance.

### Hypothesis:
#### I hypothesize that by having a visual of my daily schedule it will motivate me to complete all tasks.  By completing all tasks I will create a healthier and more productive lifestyle for myself.  I am uncertain whether this approach is sustainable due to the unpredictsability of life.  Variables can pop up spontaneously that make the schedule impossible to follow.

### Variable Interest:
#### I am interested to see the effects of waking up earlier than I am used to.  Your morning routine kind of sets the tone for the rest of the day and is the determining factor on whether the rest of the tasks get done.  I am also very interested in how having a visual of my schedule will shift my demanor towards completing tasks consistently.

# Tools to Gather Data

## Google Forms
### Google Forms gave me an easy way to build a survey and import the results to a csv file.  Once in csv format the data can be adjusted and cleaned so that it can be imported into a database.

## Calendar
### A physical calendar is the visual that will display a daily schedule that is to be considered.

# Beta Data Gathering and Revisions
## Calendar attached shows how my schedule changed from the the experimental/beta data gathering phase to the primary data gathering phase.
### The calendar throughout this process has been changed multiple times.  Initially I chose created was too zealous.  Implementing the same routine every day of the week did not make sense for how the activites in my day were laid out.  I changed the schedule so that my weekend schedule differed from my weekday schedule but I still was meant with problwms with implementation.  Finally I decided that Weekdays with class should differ rom weekdays without class due to time constraints.  Once I had a set schedule I was sent to work from home due to current events.  My final schedule was is abbreviated enough that it could possibly be implemented everyday.
