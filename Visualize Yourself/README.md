# The Perfect Schedule

## Planning

### Inquiry Question:
#### What is the overall effectiveness of the calendar schedule?
#### Is there a completely postive correlation between task completion and calendar motivation.

### Rationale:
#### I wanted to see if looking at a calendar schedule each morning and night would improve my motivation to complete certain tasks throughout the day.   I also wanted to see whether following the schedule or not would effect my feeling of life balance.

### Hypothesis:
#### I hypothesize that by having a visual of my daily schedule it will motivate me to complete all tasks.  By completing all tasks I will create a healthier and more productive lifestyle for myself.  I am uncertain whether this approach is sustainable due to the unpredictability of life.  Variables can pop up spontaneously that make the schedule impossible to follow.

### Variable Interest:
#### I am interested to see the effects of waking up earlier than I am used to.  Your morning routine kind of sets the tone for the rest of the day and is the determining factor on whether the rest of the tasks get done.  I am also very interested in how having a visual of my schedule will shift my demanor towards completing tasks consistently.

## Tools for Data

### Google Forms
#### Google Forms gave me an easy way to build a survey and import the results to a csv file.  Once in csv format the data can be adjusted and cleaned so that it can be imported into a database.  The answers to the questions range from 1 being the worst feeling/scenario and 5 being the best.  A score of 3 is nuetral which can sometimes be considered a negative if the goal is to test overall effectivenss of the schedule.

### Calendar
#### A physical calendar is the visual that will display a daily schedule that is to be considered.

### SQLite3 Database
#### Survey csv can be loaded into DB and I can use queries to get the data out.

### Matplotlib
#### Data taken out of the DB can be displayed by plotting graphs with the points gathered.

## Beta Data Gathering and Revisions
### Calendar attached shows how my schedule changed from the the experimental/beta data gathering phase to the primary data gathering phase. Throughout this process it has been changed multiple times.  Initially I created a schedule that was too zealous.  Implementing the same routine every day of the week did not make sense for how the activites in my day were laid out.  I changed the schedule so that my weekend schedule differed from my weekday schedule but I was still met with problwms with implementation.  Finally I decided that weekdays with class should differ from weekdays without class due to time constraints.  Once I had a set schedule that could fit with my work and class schedule I was sent to work from home due to current events.  My final schedule was is abbreviated enough that it could possibly be implemented everyday.

## Primary Data Gathering
### Survey created through Google Forms which will be taken every evening before going to sleep each night.  The goal is to capture my feelings of that current day regardless if I completed all tasks or not.  The 2 integral questions on the survey ask about motivation and task completion.  In order for this type of schedule to be considered effective there needs to be a consistency between motivation and task completion. 


## Analysis by Visualization 
### There are 8 graphs in total.  The main graph compares completion of tasks with calendar motivation.  I noticed many inconsistencies and nuetral answers on this graph.  There are multiple times when task completion is postive while motivation is nuetral or negative and vice versa.
